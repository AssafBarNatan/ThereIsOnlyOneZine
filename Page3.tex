\begin{thm}
  Every sequence converges.
\end{thm}
\begin{proof}
  Consider a sequence: $1,1,\ldots$ let $\eps=1$. Trivially,
  \begin{align*}
    |1-1| = |1| = 1 = \eps
  \end{align*}
\end{proof}

\begin{cor}
  Every series converges.
\end{cor}
This is left as an exercise to the reader.
