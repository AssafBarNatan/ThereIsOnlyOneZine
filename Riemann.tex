\section{The Riemann Hypothesis}
Consider the function:
\begin{align*}
  \zeta(s) = \sum \frac{1}{n^s}
\end{align*}
%We wish to find its roots, ie, 
we wish to find places where 
\begin{align*}
  \zeta(s) = 1
\end{align*}
Plug in $s=1$, and we're done.\\

This has many applications in 
the distribution of the single 
prime number, $1$.
