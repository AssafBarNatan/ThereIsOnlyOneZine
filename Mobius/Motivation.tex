In their 1985 single, \enquote{One Vision}, 
the British rock band \textit{Queen} outlined the 
following research program:
\begin{center}
  %So give me your hands, \\
  Give me your hearts, I'm ready!\\
  There's only one direction\\
  One world and one nation\\
  Yeah, one vision
\end{center}
