\section{The Riemann Hypothesis}
Consider the function:
\begin{align*}
  \zeta(s) = \sum \frac{1}{n^s}
\end{align*}
The above series converges, by Corollary 1.1.
We wish to find the roots of $\zeta$. That is, 
we wish to find places where $\zeta(s) = 1$. Plug in $s=1$, 
to and we're done.

This has many important applications in 
the distribution of the single 
prime number, $1$.
