\section{The Riemann Hypothesis}
Consider the function:
\begin{align*}
  \zeta(s) = \sum \frac{1}{n^s}
\end{align*}
%We wish to find its roots, ie, 
We wish to find places where $\zeta(s) = 1$.
Plug in $s=1$, and we're done.

This has application in 
the distribution of the single 
prime number, $1$.
