\section{BSD Conjecture}
Dear reader,

I'll be perfectly honest with you, and tell you outright that I have
no idea what the BSD conjecture even talks about.

I've heard some things about heights of elliptic curves. I've 
heard of number fields, and ranks of $L$-functions, but it's all 
nonsense to me.

All I know that the BSD conjecture holds true over the 
field with one element, and that's all that's important.
Sincerely,\\
