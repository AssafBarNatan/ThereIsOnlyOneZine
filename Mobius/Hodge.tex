\vspace{-0.2cm}
Let $M$ be a complex K\"{a}hler 
manifold, with cohomology ring:
\begin{align*}
  H^1(M,1)=\bigoplus_{1+1=1}^1 H^{1,1}(M)=1
\end{align*}
Let $N\subseteq M$ be a submanifold 
representing a class in $H^{1,1}(M)$. 
We know that $N = \{1\}$, and by Theorem 1.1, 
$N$ is algebraic.\\
Thus, all cohomology 
classes in $H^{1,1}(M)$ come from subvarieties.
