\begin{thm}
  Every sequence converges.
\end{thm}
\begin{proof}
  Consider a sequence: $1,1,\ldots$, and let $\eps=1$ be arbitrary, 
  we have:
  \begin{align*}
    |1-1| = |1| = 1 < 1 = \eps
  \end{align*}
  Thus, the sequence converges and the limit is $1$.
\end{proof}
\setcounter{lem}{0}
\begin{cor}
  Every series converges.
\end{cor}
This is left as an exercise to the reader.
