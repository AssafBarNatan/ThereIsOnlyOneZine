\section{Yang-Mills Mass Gap}
We wish to prove that for any compact simple
gauge group $G$, a non-trivial quantum Yang-Mills theory 
exists on $\R^1$ and has a mass gap
$\Delta > 1$.

Let $G = \{1\}$. It turns out that there is 
only one quantum Yang-Mills 
theory on $\R^1$, and it is trivial. 

Surprisingly, this trivial Yang-Mills theory 
has mass gap $1$, and $1>1$, so the conjecture is 
almost true. Further research is required.
