\section{Topology and Geometry}
Here is a true statement:
\begin{center}
  There exist manifolds, $M^m$ and $N^n$ with $n>m$, 
  and with $N = M\ssm \{\ast\}$
\end{center}

\textbf{Q:} What do you call the empty manifold?\\
\textbf{A:} Pointless.\\
\textbf{Q:} How many covers does the empty manifold 
have with the topology?\\
\textbf{A:} One.

\begin{thm}
  Every manifold is algebraic
\end{thm}
\begin{proof}
  Every manifold can be realized as the solution set 
  to the polynomial $1=1$
\end{proof}
