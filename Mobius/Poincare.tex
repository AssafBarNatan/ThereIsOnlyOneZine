\section{Poincar\'{e} Conjecture}
Here is another true statement
\begin{center}
  There is only one manifold: $\{1\}$
\end{center}

\begin{proof}
  Every manifold is locally homeomorphic to $\{1\}$, by the 
  (smooth) function $f(1) = 1$. This homeomorphism 
  extends to a global homeomorphism by setting $f(1)=1$.
\end{proof}

\begin{cor}
  Let $M$ be a simply-connected, closed $1$-manifold. Then 
  $M$ is homeomorphic to $\{1\}$.
\end{cor}

There are also other proofs of this fact which use 
Ricci Flow with surgery.
