README:

Okay, so this zine is a bit more complicated than usual. This
directory contains a usual zine. Compile main.tex, then Step1.tex, and 
then ThereIsOnlyOne.tex, which will create a two-sided PDF. 

Print this PDF on letter-sized paper, and cut in the usual 8-page 
per-paper zine pattern. Fold. There are two zines here. One on the 
inside, one on the outside.

The second directory, Mobius, contains a version of this zine that 
should be printed and cut and pasted to form a 
Mobius band. To create it, compile main.tex, followed 
by ThereIsOnlyOneSide.tex.

You can then print this on letter paper, cut lengthwise, and glue, or, 
you can edit this PDF to add the scissors and glue icons giving gluing 
instructions.
